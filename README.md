## üìñ About the Project

This project was developed as part of a university assignment to explore the use of interactive technologies in education. The goal is to:  
- **Explain** dyslexia and dyscalculia with visual examples.  
- **Simulate** the experiences of those with these learning differences.  
- **Engage** users with interactive content and mini-games.  

By blending education with interaction, the project aims to foster understanding and empathy.
