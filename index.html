      <h2>What is Dyslexia?</h2>
      <p>
        Dyslexia is a learning difference that affects how people read, spell, 
        and process language. It's not related to intelligence but rather to the 
        way the brain processes written words and symbols. People with dyslexia might 
        find it challenging to connect letters with their sounds, making reading slower 
        and more effortful. Dyslexia is common and varies in severity; some people might struggle mainly with reading, 
        while others could find writing or spelling particularly difficult. With support, such as specialized 
        instruction and reading strategies, individuals with dyslexia can improve their skills and thrive in learning environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        People with dyslexia may experience challenges in various areas, including reading,
        writing, and processing information. Here are some examples of struggles they might face:
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Reading Challenges:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Slow Reading: </strong>Taking longer to read and understand text compared to peers.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Decoding: </strong>Difficulty breaking down words into individual sounds and blending them together</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping Words or Lines: </strong>Losing their place in text, skipping over words, or re-reading the same line.</li>
        <li><strong>Misreading Words: </strong>Confusing similar-looking words like "form" and "from" or "was" and "saw."</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Memory and Processing Struggles:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Short-Term Memory Issues: </strong>Forgetting instructions or sequences, like steps in solving a math problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty with Sequencing: </strong>Struggling to arrange letters, numbers, or events in the correct order (e.g., writing "214" instead of "124").</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Information Processing: </strong>Taking extra time to understand written or spoken language.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Writing and Spelling Difficulties:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spelling Errors: </strong>Struggling to spell words correctly, often writing them phonetically (e.g., “defanition” instead of “definition”).</li>
        <li><strong>Letter Reversals: </strong>Up letters like "b" and "d" or "p" and "q," especially in early development.</li>
        <li><strong>Messy Handwriting: </strong>With spacing and letter formation, leading to illegible handwriting. </li>
        <li><strong>Sentence Structure: </strong>Struggling to organize thoughts clearly in writing or mixing up word order.</li>
      </ul>
