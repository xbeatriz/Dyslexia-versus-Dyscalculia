      <h2>What is Dyslexia?</h2>
      <p>
        Dyslexia is a learning difference that affects how people read, spell, 
        and process language. It's not related to intelligence but rather to the 
        way the brain processes written words and symbols. People with dyslexia might 
        find it challenging to connect letters with their sounds, making reading slower 
        and more effortful. Dyslexia is common and varies in severity; some people might struggle mainly with reading, 
        while others could find writing or spelling particularly difficult. With support, such as specialized 
        instruction and reading strategies, individuals with dyslexia can improve their skills and thrive in learning environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        People with dyslexia may experience challenges in various areas, including reading,
        writing, and processing information. Here are some examples of struggles they might face:
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Reading Challenges:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Slow Reading: </strong>Taking longer to read and understand text compared to peers.</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping Words or Lines: </strong>Losing their place in text, skipping over words, or re-reading the same line.</li>
        <li><strong>Misreading Words: </strong>Confusing similar-looking words like "form" and "from" or "was" and "saw."</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Memory and Processing Struggles:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Short-Term Memory Issues: </strong>Forgetting instructions or sequences, like steps in solving a math problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty with Sequencing: </strong>Struggling to arrange letters, numbers, or events in the correct order (e.g., writing "214" instead of "124").</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Information Processing: </strong>Taking extra time to understand written or spoken language.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Writing and Spelling Difficulties:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spelling Errors: </strong>Struggling to spell words correctly, often writing them phonetically (e.g., “defanition” instead of “definition”).</li>
        <li><strong>Letter Reversals: </strong>Up letters like "b" and "d" or "p" and "q," especially in early development.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentence Structure: </strong>Struggling to organize thoughts clearly in writing or mixing up word order.</li>
      </ul>

          <h2>What is Dyscalculia?</h2>
          <p>
            Dyscalculia is a learning difference that affects a person's ability to
            understand and work with numbers. Often referred to as "math dyslexia," it
            impacts number-related skills like arithmetic, understanding numerical
            concepts, and performing calculations. Dyscalculia is not related to
            intelligence but to how the brain processes numerical and mathematical
            information. It can vary in severity, with some people facing challenges
            with basic number sense while others struggle with more advanced math
            tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with dyscalculia may experience challenges in various areas,
            including understanding numbers, performing arithmetic, and applying math
            to everyday life. Here are some examples of struggles they might face:
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Understanding Numbers and Basic Concepts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Recognizing Patterns: </strong>Trouble identifying numerical
              patterns, such as sequences or relationships between numbers (e.g., 2,
              4, 6, 8).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Difficulty with Number Sense: </strong>Struggling to understand
              the quantity represented by a number (e.g., not realizing "5" means five
              items).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Performing Arithmetic</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Trouble with Basic Operations: </strong>Difficulty performing
              addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, even with practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Carrying Over or Borrowing: </strong>Struggling to carry numbers
              in addition or borrow in subtraction
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Applying Math to Everyday Life</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Handling Money: </strong>Trouble calculating change, budgeting,
              or understanding the value of coins and bills.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Estimating: </strong>Inability to approximate costs, distances,
              or amounts (e.g., estimating how much paint is needed for a wall).
            </li>
